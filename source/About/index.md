I’m James.

I do various things online which have increasingly become spread all over the place. This site is my personal site, curating all my work in one place, via links. Previously I was at meta-nomad.net, then jdemeta.net, and now here. 

Why the move? I have *almost* zero interest in comments, likes, or follows, etc. I say *almost* because I am not digitally anti-social, only that most comments amount to nothing at all, and any sincere comment would likely have been a more personal email if the comment section didn’t exist. Comment sections are for people who have something to prove, which I don’t. I am not really trying to convince anyone of anything. Besides, when did debate, argument, or disproof change a thing?

My worldview has changed a lot over the years. Beginning with absurdism, moving through occultism, to nihilism, to Catholicism, and now back to what I am defining as ‘kosmic nihilism’. This ‘position’, very roughly, is nihilism outside of the bounds of the usual humanly existential-Recursivity nihilism is tethered to. 

I have a B.A. in Fine Art, and an M.A. in Continental Philosophy.
