title: A Quick Note on God & Faith

Those who have followed me for sometime may ask ‘What happened to the Catholicism?’, and those who have just come across my writing also may ask ‘Why is there an introductory book on Christianity in your bibliography?’ The answer is that for a while I did ‘believe’ in God, but that belief was, as a matter of fact, me _telling myself_ I believed in God.

This might all appear strange considering I was first an atheist, then a fervent anti-theist, an occultist, a Catholic, and now, again, a nihilist. How is it, one may ask, that after such a drastic leap (read: _Troens Spring_\[1\]) one could return to the initial point of departure? It _could_ be argued that as such is the case, that I therefore _never left_ the original position. It _could_ be argued that I fell from grace or actively shunned grace. It _could_ be argued that I never really _understood_ God and so what I received was incorrect. All of these _could_ be argued with the intensity of a Protestant theologian, but in the words of Sarah Perry, speaking of her book [_Every Cradle is a Grave_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Every-Cradle-Grave-Rethinking-Suicide/dp/0989697290)

“Seeing that everybody is wrong in a particular way, coming up with the best case I could for why they’re wrong, publishing it, and realizing it didn’t change anything and never will, because people don’t update based on arguments.” [Link](https://suspendedreason.com/2016/12/30/the-political-is-always-personal-a-conversation-with-sarah-perry/)

I believe that last part—”people don’t update based on arguments”—to be both true and of the utmost importance. Of course, me considering it to be of the ‘utmost importance’ doesn’t matter, because people don’t update based on arguments, you see the bind here? I don’t want to put words in Perry’s mouth, and so this is me speaking now.

If it such that people do not update based on arguments, it could be stated—as a type of antithesis to argument, which is pure theory—that people update on experience (if they update at all). And so, the argumentation of theology is vast, it is as wide as an ocean, and, surprisingly, as deep as an ocean, too. One can get lost in theological tricks for multiple lifetimes.

But this isn’t how ideas work. One doesn’t go read an essay, a book, a collection of books and suddenly internally agree with an idea or, more drastically, change their mind. One has established ideological priors founded from their life circumstances that they bring with them. The ideas come first, book learning is just there to justify what is already hauntingly present, which is likely an unconscious experience of some kind. No amount of theory can usurp one’s present experiential reality.

So what was the _leap_ I engaged in? It was, almost certainly, what Oswald Spengler called ‘Second Religiosity’ or [‘Second Religiousness’](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decline_of_the_West#Religion_and_secularity). With the reformation being followed—for Spengler—by a period on rationalism, then a second religiosity that correlates with decline. Writ more abstractly, in the post-death-of-God world that is _explicitly_ void of meaning, whilst simultaneously collapsing, one hastily and nostalgically reaches _back_ to an older form of order for meaning and purpose. Of course, we can never ‘go back’. We’ve known this ever since the days of Heraclitus.

"It is not possible to step into the same river twice" — Plutarch, _On the E at Delphi_

Going back is an attempt to swim upriver whilst the currents—the passage of time—gush past you. Eventually your energy will plummet and you have to accept your fate. For me, looking back, having faith was this process in minutiae. Finding myself constantly and ceaselessly having to fuel and maintain something that never made itself apparent _in itself_. Faith, a metaphysical gaslighting of the self. There was never an _experience_ there for me, never enough of anything for the theory to follow without complaint. If it is such that one or many have had _experiences,_ then it follows as to why they can remain alive amidst so many contradictions. But to walk into the fray of burden of proof sans experiential ammunition, soon enough you’ll find yourself not necessarily retreating, but merely dissipating into the soil, the ordeal disappearing into the air absurdity that always surrounded it.

Will I be _railing against_ God from now on? No. Experience is inherently solipsistic (as per Wittgenstein), and so what can I say of other’s existences? Nothing at all.

As for me, that can be summed up in my all time favourite quote:
