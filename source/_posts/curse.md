title: The Curse of Recursivity

*The human race comes from nothing and goes to nothing. Beyond this there is nothing.* - Peter Wessel Zapffe

*And all once was and will return*
*As, without cease, life spins its whirling fabric*
*Through eternal aeons*. - Ludwig Klages, *Life*

The history of philosophy is one of abstract geometry: Point, line, circle, and cycle denote various phases pertaining to immanentize idea to shape. Yet, by its geometrical definition, the circle is the last of all, one of many representations of the infinite. A shape that has infinite sides, never ends, and consumes itself eternally. The circle is that from which one cannot escape, and knowledge from _within_ which only begets greater knowledge of escape’s impossibility. For instance, abstractly, is not the infantile task _against_ nihilism simply an attempt to try to escape the circle of nihil itself? All friction against and wrestling with nihil is a bolster of its eternal horizon. The circle, or, if you wish, that which returns, is that which recurs upon and _of_ itself as reminder of escape’s impossibility. Recurrence is from itself, unto itself, forever more.

The human being, understood as a self-aware/self-interrogative/self-conscious being, is, as such, an ontologically Recursive being. To repeat, the human knows that it knows that it knows that it knows… The human being understands that it _is_ and understands that it _knows_ that it *is…*The human being is _aware_ of the fact it _exists…_ and on and on such recursions go. For anyone versed in even the basics of philosophy, such examples of what I am calling ‘Recursion’ or ‘Recursivity’ are themselves abstracted or condensed formulations of common philosophical questions, for example: ‘What is it to be human?’, ‘What is the meaning of life?’, and ‘Why are we alive?’ are all questions that take Recursivity as a fact, that is, all of these questions take for granted the fact that we (human beings) know that we can know, are aware that we’re aware, etc. Multiple philosophers have made the study of Recursivity (in their own language) the foundation of their philosophy, and so I do not _dare_ to lay claim to the idea that this notion is in any sense original. Recursivity, as seen from the Zapffean point of view, is a curse unto itself-

_“Whatever happened? A breach in the very unity of life, a biological paradox, an abomination, an absurdity, an exaggeration of disastrous nature.”_ (_The Last Messiah,_ Zapffe)

That _breach_ that tears apart the fabric of primal equilibrium, splitting asunder kosmic Eros, the malevolent decoupler brings forth the ontological curse of the Recur! Against all vital rhythm Geist, the great breach, brings with it all notions of its own _descension_ and infects the human organism with its sense of self of self of self; forevermore found in thought and thus falsely outside of the kosmic rhythm man wallows in the circle…

What I seek to do is to enquire into the nature of Recursivity and the nihil hidden within its recursive function, striving to perceive its ontological possibilities in relation to the human being.
